I work on [Self Host Blocks](https://github.com/ibizaman/selfhostblocks) and [Skatabox](https://github.com/ibizaman/skatabox) to lower the bar of entry to these domains.

I am also interested in distributed programming and declarative infrastructure as well as IoT electronics and smart home projects.
